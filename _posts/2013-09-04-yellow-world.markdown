This is my first post using jekyll. I always wanted to give it a try but I never really had the time (who ever does?). 

And to make it official:
 
{% highlight ruby %}
puts "Yellow World"
{% endhighlight %}

This ridiculously simple code brings me memories of my first Hello World in C.

This can only mean one thing. I'm getting old.
